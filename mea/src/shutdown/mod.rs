//! A composite synchronization primitive for managing shutdown signals.
//!
//! This module provides [`new_pair`] to create a pair of handles for managing shutdown signals:
//!
//! * [`ShutdownSend`] can send a shutdown signal, and can wait for all the tasks to finish.
//! * [`ShutdownRecv`] can wait for the shutdown signal, and should be dropped when the task is
//!   done, which will notify the sender on all the tasks finished.
//! * [`ShutdownWatch`] can wait for the shutdown signal without blocking
//!   [`ShutdownSend::await_shutdown`].
//!
//! Internally, the shutdown signal is implemented using a countdown latch, and the task completion
//! is tracked using a wait group. [`ShutdownSend`] is cloneable, allowing multiple sources to send
//! the shutdown signal; [`ShutdownRecv`] is also cloneable, allowing multiple tasks to wait for the
//! same shutdown signal.
//!
//! [`ShutdownSend::await_shutdown`] would block until all the tasks are done, i.e., all the
//! [`ShutdownRecv`]s dropped.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ```
//! # #[tokio::main]
//! # async fn main() {
//! let (tx, rx) = mea::shutdown::new_pair();
//!
//! for i in 0..3 {
//!     let rx = rx.clone();
//!     tokio::spawn(async move {
//!         println!("Task {} starting", i);
//!         rx.is_shutdown().await;
//!         println!("Task {} done", i);
//!     });
//! }
//! drop(rx);
//!
//! tx.shutdown();
//! tx.await_shutdown().await;
//! # }
//! ```
