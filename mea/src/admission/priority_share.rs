/// A priority-bound handle in a priority-share admission family.
///
/// [`PriorityShare::new`] creates one handle per configured priority, ordered
/// from lowest to highest. Those handles share one capacity and one scheduler.
/// A handle keeps its priority when it is moved or cloned, so acquisition
/// methods do not take a priority argument. Separate constructor calls create
/// independent admission families.
///
/// Configuration entries add capacity from the lowest to the highest priority.
/// The admission limit at priority `p` is the sum of entries up to and
/// including `p`, and every assigned permit counts toward that limit regardless
/// of its priority. For example, `[4, 1]` lets priority 0 enter while fewer than
/// four permits are assigned and priority 1 while fewer than five are assigned.
/// A higher priority can therefore use all shared capacity, including headroom
/// unavailable to lower priorities.
///
/// When contended, the highest eligible priority is admitted first. Within
/// that priority, the owner with the fewest permits currently held across all
/// priorities is admitted first. Ties are resolved by queue order. The same
/// owner may acquire and wait at multiple priorities; all of its permits count
/// toward one fair-share identity.
///
/// Priority only affects admission. An acquisition that has already been
/// assigned a permit is never revoked for later higher-priority work. Sustained
/// higher-priority demand can therefore starve lower priorities, and reserved
/// headroom can remain unused while lower-priority work waits. Priorities with
/// equal admission limits still differ under contention because the higher one
/// is admitted first.
///
/// Observation methods without a `total_` prefix describe this handle's bound
/// priority. The `total_` variants describe the entire admission family and
/// return the same value from every handle in that family.
