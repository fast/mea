//! Admission control policies for bounded asynchronous work.
//!
//! This module provides [`FairShare`], a work-conserving admission policy for
//! workloads partitioned by key, and [`PriorityShare`], which adds strict
//! priorities and reserved headroom within one shared capacity. Both policies
//! admit work for the key with the fewest permits currently held. For
//! [`PriorityShare`], that count spans all priorities and is considered after
//! selecting the highest eligible priority. Ties are resolved by queue order.
//!
//! Fairness applies to the number of permits held by contending keys. Neither
//! policy accounts for differences in execution time or work cost.
//! [`FairShare`] does not reserve permits for idle keys. [`PriorityShare`] uses
//! admission thresholds to reserve headroom for higher priorities, so capacity
//! can remain unused while lower-priority work waits. Its constructor returns
//! one priority-bound handle per configured threshold; all of those handles
//! share the same scheduler.
